    <h1 class="text-primary">Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`.</h1>
    <h4>VAR:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use it when we want a variable to be accessible throughout an entire function or the whole program.</li>
        <li>Can be changed later if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>LET:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use it when we want a variable to be limited to a specific block of code.</li>
        <li>Can be changed later if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>CONST:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use it when we want a variable to stay the same (not change) within a block of code.</li>
        <li>For numbers and text, it can't be changed. For lists of things, we can add or remove items, but we can't replace the whole list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-primary">Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>
    <h4>NULL:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Think of it as an intentional empty value. We use it when we want to say, This thing has no value on purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>UNDEFINED:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Think of it as the default empty value. It's what we get when something hasn't been given value. If we see undefined, it often means no one set a value here, or something doesn't exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="text-primary">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>REST API is like a special language for computers on the internet. Everything online has its unique address, just like houses. When we want something, we give simple instructionsâ€”like asking for stuff or changing things. Each time we talk, it's like starting a new chat; no one remembers what i said before. There are two sides we ask for things, and another computer gives them. It's an easy and organized way for computers to talk and do things online.</li>
    </ul>
